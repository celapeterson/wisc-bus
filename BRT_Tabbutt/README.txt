########### Some basic Guidance on the things in this folder and the code: #############
########################################################################################


### All the data that you need to run the functions is already in this folder. You may need to add more if you decide to do more things with the functions like adding passenger boarding data etc. 



1. First you want to open up the parsing notebook and run it. This will create some JSON and CSV files that you will need later. This notebook may take a bit to run, but you would only run it once ideally and then all the functions just read in the files that it produces. 


####### Files: #######

# Collection of Maps:	A collection of all the types of maps and plotting that I did in one notebook as a sort of template or launching point. 


# Heat Maps of Accessibility_Specific Routes_No BRT:	This will create and plot heat maps, for specific routes (or all) for a specific time of day. It does not include the BRT. You need to assign the main function a time as well as a ride key (weekday, night time etc, see documentation). 





### Extra Codes: 
	
	Codes that are in executable condition but were just messing around something extra, exploring some idea etc. Not commented 	well but should work. Might be something in there to poke around in:

		- Analyzing ridership
